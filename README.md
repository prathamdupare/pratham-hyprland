# Hyprland Setup

Welcome to my Hyprland setup on GitHub! This project showcases my personalized configuration for various tools and applications to create a customized desktop environment.

## Description

My Hyprland setup includes the following components:

- Window Manager: Hyprland
- Shell: Bash
- Terminal: Foot
- Launcher: Wofi
- File Manager: Ranger
- Notify Daemon: Dunst
- Panel: Waybar
- Browser: Firefox

I also use Pywal to customize the theme of my desktop environment based on the wallpaper I have set. Pywal picks colors from the wallpaper in real-time and applies them to Waybar and the terminal. Additionally, I use Pywalfox to colorize the Firefox theme according to Pywal's colors.
