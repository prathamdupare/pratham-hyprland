Theme Customization :art:

I use Pywal to dynamically customize the theme of my setup based on the wallpaper I have set. Pywal picks colors from the wallpaper and applies them in real-time to Waybar and the terminal, giving a cohesive look to my setup. Additionally, I use Pywalfox to apply the Pywal colors to the Firefox theme, creating a consistent visual experience.
